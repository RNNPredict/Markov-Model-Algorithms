Markov Model Algorithms
=====================================

Python/C package for analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations.
In particular, it includes algorithms for estimation, validation and analysis
of:

  * Clustering and Featurization
  * Markov state models (MSMs)
  * Hidden Markov models (HMMs)
  * Multi-ensemble Markov models (MEMMs)
  * Time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA)
  * Transition Path Theory (TPT)
